# pycodebench

## Mission

pycodebench's mission is to be THE referenceable source for ad-hoc Python code benchmarks. Code benchmarking is rarely needed and is often re-learned each time a segment of code needs to be assessed. pycodebench allows users to submit code snippets which are profiled and able to be compared with other executions. The profiling output can be referenced via URL to foster a better collaboration experience (StackOverflow, Pull Requests, Issues, etc).
