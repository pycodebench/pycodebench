# Project Planning

## Initial Release (Minimum Viable Product)

Website with the following capabilities:

* Run a Python code snippet and view execution time
* Reference that specific test at a unique URL
* Copy a executed test as a new test, allowing for modification before re-execution

## Roadmap Features

In no particular order:

* Better interactive user interface for execution and comparing up to three versions of the code
* Additional code-profiling capabilities (pycallgraph or similar)
* Additional base system configuration (memory/cpu sliders)
* Dependency injection, such as providing a requirements.txt
* Try It Yourself! functionality where a user can download their snippet with boilerplate to use locally
* Expiration of old executions, probably based off time since last view

## Will Not Implement

* Non-Python runtimes
